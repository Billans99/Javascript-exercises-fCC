                Skipped Regex because Baker said it's not needed







                Started Debugging:

                Notes: 

Useful to console.log() 
    To check that previous calculations are
    performing correctly. Console also has console.warn() and console.clear().
    console.clear(); clears the log. 

Below are examples of typeof:
    let myVar1 = "3";
    let myVar2 = 2;
    console.log(typeof myVar1);
    console.log(typeof myVar2);
        string
        number

Javascript has 7 immutable datatypes:
    1. Boolean
    2. Null
    3. Undefined
    4. Number
    5. String
    6. Symbol
    7. BigInt

Spelling mistakes will show as reference error and myVar is not defined. 

Always add the second half of pair types () {} [] to avoid forgetting it 
later on.

Don't forget about using the escape key \ when using quotes in a string.
You can also decide to use the different quotes " ''

Remember:
    = is the assignment operator. Equality == and strict equality === are to
    check if something is equal to something else. 

    Dont forget to add parenthesis () to the end of a function or method when 
    delcaring it and also calling it.
    Usually the value returned at end of function is assigned to a variable.

 OBOE
    Off by one errors typically occur in an index of a string or array.
    e.g. for (let i = 1; i < myVar.length ; i++);
    This will skip the first element of the array. Correct code would be
    e.g. for (let i = 0; i < myVar.length; i++);

Caution when reinitialising variable inside a loop.
    In some loops you may need to reinitialize a variable INSIDE the loop
    or even take out the reinitialized variable when it is not needed.
    Example of initializing a variable e.g. let row = [];

Dreaded infinite loops.
    Loops need a terminal condition. Infinite loops are likely to freeze or 
    crash the browser. 





                Data structures:

                Arrays()

Assign variable to element in an array 
    const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const myVar = myArray[1];
    myVar is now = 2

Change an element inside array index
    const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    myArray[1] = "Billy";
    console.log(myArray)
    [1, "Billy, 3, 4, 5];

Add elements to the start of array
    myArray.unshift("Billy", 7);

Add elements to end of array
    myArray.push("myString", 7);

Remove element from start of array. 
    Note: it can only remove one element.
    myArray.shift();

Remove element from end of array.
    Note: it can only remove one element.
    myArray.pop();

Return or assign pop() or shift value to variable
    let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let popped = myArray.pop();

Remove middle of array or multiple elements using splice()
    let myArray = ["I", "am", "feeling", "really", "happy"]
    let newArray = myArray.splice(3, 2);

    console.log(newArray);
    ["really", "happy"]
    console.log(myArray)
    ["I", "am", "feeling"];

Remove middle elements of array to swap elements using splice()
    const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
    const startIndex = 3;
    const amountToDelete = 1;

    numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
    console.log(numbers);

Copy elements of array without change original using slice()
    Note: 
    slice(param1, param2) takes in two parameters, first is when to start
    and the second is when to stop. It excludes the element it stops at. 
    
    let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];
    let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);

    console.log(todaysWeather);
    ["snow", "sleet"]
    console.log(weatherConditions);
    ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

Use spread ... to copy another array into another variable
    let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
    let thatArray = [...thisArray];

                    EXTRA NOTES FROM ES6 EXERCISES:

1. Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords
        Notes:
        Declaring var will declare it globally or locally. Let can be
        be declared in a block, statement or expression. Let was introduced in 
        ES6, never use var. Remember to use const always unless you think it should
        be mutable.

2. Mutate an Array Declared with const
        Notes: 
        You can declare const s = [5, 7, 2]; but cant redeclare it later 
        saying const s = [2, 7, 5]. You can however mutate the array e.g. s[0] = 2;
        s[1] = 7; s[2] = 5; After this your array would now be [2, 7, 5]. Nice!

3. Prevent Object Mutation
        Notes: 
        Object.freeze(object);
        Properties cannot be added, deleted or changed, as well as their
        corresponding values.

4. Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions
        Notes:
        Functions are usually written like this: 

        const myFunc = function() {
            const myVar = "value";
            return myVar;
        }
        However, with ES6 arrow functions look like this:{
            const myFunc = () => {
                const myVar = "value";
                return myVar;
            }
        When there is no body function and only a return value it can be shortened
        even further to this: 
            const myFunc = () => "value";

5. Write Arrow Functions with Parameters
        Notes:
        Arrow functions can also parse parameters e.g.
            const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
            doubler(4);
        If there is only one parameter, the () parentheses can be removed. e.g.
            const doubler = item => item * 2;
            doubler(4);
        Here's an example of a two parameter arrow function.
            const multiplier = (item, multi) => item * multi;
            multiplier(4, 2);

6. Set Default Parameters for Your Functions
        Notes:
        ES6 has default parameters for functions. 
            const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => "Hello " + name;

            console.log(greeting("John"));
            console.log(greeting());
        The first console.log will display the strings Hello John, and the second
        will return Hello Anonymous.

 7. Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters
        const sum = (...args) => {
            const sum = (...args) => {
                let total = 0;
                for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
                total += args[i];
                }
                return total;
            }
            console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6

 8. Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place
        const arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
        let arr2;
        
        arr2 = [...arr1];  // Change this line
        
        console.log(arr2);

 9. Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects
        const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
            yesterday: 75,
            today: 77,
            tomorrow: 80
        };
        
        // Only change code below this line
        const {today} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
        const {tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES
        
        // const today = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
        // const tomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow;
        
        // Only change code above this line

 10. Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects
        const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
            yesterday: 75,
            today: 77,
            tomorrow: 80
        };
        
        // Only change code below this line
        const {highToday: today} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
        const {highTomorrow: tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
        
        const {today: highToday} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES; 
        const {tomorrow: highTomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
        // const highToday = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
        // const highTomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow; 
        
        // Only change code above this line

 11. Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects
        const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
            yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
            today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
            tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
        };
        
        // Only change code below this line
        const { today: {low: lowToday, high: highToday}} = LOCAL_FORECAST;  
        
        // const lowToday = LOCAL_FORECAST.today.low;
        // const highToday = LOCAL_FORECAST.today.high;
        
        // Only change code above this line

 12. Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays
        let a = 8, b = 6;
        // Only change code below this line
        [a, b] = [b, a];

 13. Destructuring via rest elements
        function removeFirstTwo(list) {
            const [a, b, ...newArray] = list;
            return newArray;
        }
        
        const source = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
        const sourceWithoutFirstTwo = removeFirstTwo(source);

 14. Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters
        const stats = {
            max: 56.78,
            standard_deviation: 4.34,
            median: 34.54,
            mode: 23.87,
            min: -0.75,
            average: 35.85
        };
        
        // Only change code below this line
        const half = ({ max, min }) => (max + min) / 2.0;
        
        // Only change code above this line

  15. Create Strings using Template Literals
        Notes: 
        Template literals are performed with backticks `` and 
        ${variable/object} or ${object.prop}

        const result = {
            success: ["max-length", "no-amd", "prefer-arrow-functions"],
            failure: ["no-var", "var-on-top", "linebreak"],
            skipped: ["no-extra-semi", "no-dup-keys"]
        };
        function makeList(arr) {
            // Only change code below this line
            const failureItems = [];
            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            failureItems.push(`<li class="text-warning">${arr[i]}</li>`)
        
            }
            
            // Only change code above this line
        
            return failureItems;
        }
        
        const failuresList = makeList(result.failure);
    
  16. Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand
        Notes:
        Use object property shorthand with object literals

        const createPerson = (name, age, gender) => 
        // Only change code below this line
        ({name, age, gender});

  17. Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6
        Notes: 
        functions can be declared in an object. Also the word "function" and
        colon can be removed in ES6 to make it look cleaner to read.

        // Only change code below this line
        const bicycle = {
            gear: 2,
            setGear(newGear) {
            this.gear = newGear;
            }
        };
        // Only change code above this line
        bicycle.setGear(3);
        console.log(bicycle.gear);

  18. Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function
        Notes: 
        - Classes are a blueprint for creating (it can also be referred to as 
        instantiating) objects
        - Classes can also have functions which are called methods
        - Classes can also have properties
        - The most common thing that you do in the constructor is to set properties 
        on the class
        - to create a new instance of a class, use the key word "new" and then 
        the class name. E.g "new Spaceship"
        - the constructor a method is a special method that is called when 
        creating an instance of a class
        - when accessing properties in the class, you will need to use the 
        key word "this" e.g this.myProperty
        - They typically use UpperCamelCase as the name e.g. SpaceShuttle . 

        // Only change code below this line
        class Vegetable {
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name; 
        }
        }
        // Only change code above this line

        const carrot = new Vegetable('carrot');
        console.log(carrot.name); // Should display 'carrot'

19. Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object
        Notes: 
        Getter functions are meant to simply return (get) the value of an object's 
        private variable to the user without the user directly accessing the 
        private variable.

        Setter functions are meant to modify (set) the value of an object's private
        variable based on the value passed into the setter function. This change 
        could involve calculations, or even overwriting the previous value 
        completely.
        Getters and setters are important as they hide internal implementation 
        details. It is convention to put underscore because private variable _. 
        e.g. _author . Although doing it does not make it private.

        // Only change code below this line
        class Thermostat {
        constructor(fahrenheit) {
            this._fahrenheit = fahrenheit;
        }

        get temperature() {
            return 5/9 * (this._fahrenheit - 32);
        }

        set temperature(celcius) {
        return this._fahrenheit = (celcius * 9.0) / 5 + 32;
        }
        }
        // Only change code above this line

        const thermos = new Thermostat(76); // Setting in Fahrenheit scale
        let temp = thermos.temperature; // 24.44 in Celsius
        thermos.temperature = 26;
        temp = thermos.temperature; // 26 in Celsius

20. Create a module script. 
        Notes: 
        With the `<script="module" src="index.js"></script>` you
        can export files for use in other files or import the parts you need, 
        where you need.

        <html>
        <body>
            <!-- Only change code below this line -->
        <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
            <!-- Only change code above this line -->
        </body>
        </html>

21. Use export to Share a Code Block
        Notes: The last line of code is how to export. In the example below, 
        the function names are used as arguments for the export in order to export 
        the functions.

        const uppercaseString = (string) => {
        return string.toUpperCase();
        }

        const lowercaseString = (string) => {
        return string.toLowerCase()
        }

        export {uppercaseString, lowercaseString};

        Here's another example.

        const add = (x, y) => {
        return x + y;
        }

        export { add };


22. Reuse JavaScript Code Using import
        Notes: 
        Following from the export code from above, in the new file where you want 
        to import what you exported, write

        import {uppercaseString, lowercaseString} from './string_functions.js';
        // Only change code above this line
        uppercaseString("hello");
        lowercaseString("WORLD!");

        Here's another example:
        import { add } from './math_functions.js';


23. Use * to Import Everything from a File
        Notes:
        To import everything from a file: use,
        import * as stringFunctions from "./string_functions.js"
        // Only change code above this line

        stringFunctions.uppercaseString("hello");
        stringFunctions.lowercaseString("WORLD!");

        Here's another example. Dont forget it has to have ./ before file name.
        import * as myMathModule from "./math_functions.js";

24. Create an Export Fallback with export default
        Notes:
        Default export adds a fallback value for a module or file.
        Below is a regular function:

        function subtract(x, y) {
        return x - y;
        } 
        Now we will add default export fallback
        export default function subtract(x, y) {
        return x - y;
        }

25. Import a Default Export
        Notes: 
        Here is how to import a default export from question 24. 

        import subtract from "./math_functions.js"
        // Only change code above this line

        subtract(7,4);

26. Create a JavaScript Promise
        Notes: promises are useed to make a promise, usually asynchronously.
        Promise is a constructor function so u use the new keyword e.g. 
        new Promise . Resolve parameter is used when you want your promise to 
        succeed. Reject is used when you want it to fail. 
        Here is an example below. 
        const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

        });

27. Complete a Promise with resolve and reject
        Notes: 
        A promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, rejected. The previous
        promise in Q.26 will always be pending because there's no way to complete
        the promise. 
        Here's an example of completing a promise with resolve and reject.
        const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // responseFromServer represents a response from a server
        let responseFromServer;
            
        if(responseFromServer) {
        resolve("We got the data");
        } else {  
            reject("Data not received");
        }
        return responseFromServer;
        });

28. Handle a Fulfilled Promise with then
        Notes: 
        Then is used to action it to do something when the promised is resolved. 
        In this case it console logs the result which is "We got the data"
        const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
        let responseFromServer = true;
            
        if(responseFromServer) {
            resolve("We got the data");
        } else {  
            reject("Data not received");
        }
        });

        makeServerRequest.then(result => {
        console.log(result);
        });

29. Handle a rejected promise with catch
        Notes: 
        Catch is used to action a promise that is rejected. It happens right after
        the rejection is called. 
        Here's an example of how of syntax: 

        const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // responseFromServer is set to false to represent an unsuccessful response from a server
        let responseFromServer = false;
            
        if(responseFromServer) {
            resolve("We got the data");
        } else {  
            reject("Data not received");
        }
        });

        makeServerRequest.then(result => {
        console.log(result);
        makeServerRequest.catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
        })
        });
