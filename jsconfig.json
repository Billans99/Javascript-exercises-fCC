Notes: 
Useful to console.log() to check that previous calculations are
performing correctly. Console also has console.warn() and console.clear().

console.clear(); clears the log. 

Below are examples of typeof:
let myVar1 = "3";
let myVar2 = 2;
console.log(typeof myVar1);
console.log(typeof myVar2);
    string
    number

Javascript has 7 immutable datatypes:
1. Boolean
2. Null
3. Undefined
4. Number
5. String
6. Symbol
7. BigInt

Spelling mistakes will show as reference error and myVar is not defined. 

Always add the second half of pair types () {} [] to avoid forgetting it 
later on.
